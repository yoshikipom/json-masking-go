	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command

	// maskCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	maskCmd.Flags().StringArrayP("deny", "d", []string{}, "deny key list")
